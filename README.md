## Introduction:
This is a personal java project I built using the LibGDX library. It is a PC game featuring different levels in which the player has to cross different types of challenges. When creating this game I was inspired by the game Dungeons & Dragons and wanted to make a game that would encompass the feeling of playing a D&D campaign.
